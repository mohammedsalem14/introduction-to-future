        <h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, reason, and make decisions like humans. AI can be categorized into two types: Narrow AI, which is designed to perform a specific task (e.g., facial recognition, language translation), and General AI, which is designed to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.

        <p>
            AI is revolutionizing industries by improving efficiency, enabling automation, and creating new opportunities for innovation. From self-driving cars to personal assistants like Siri and Alexa, AI is transforming how we live and work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some key areas of AI include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and robotics. These technologies allow machines to learn from data, make predictions, and continuously improve their performance.

        <p>
            AI holds enormous potential to solve complex problems, improve healthcare, optimize business processes, and drive advancements in technology. However, it also raises important ethical questions about privacy, bias, and the impact on jobs and society.
